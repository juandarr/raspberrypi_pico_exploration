This repository store my tests and exploration with the Raspberry Pi Pico family of microncontrollers. My initial focus is the Pico W, but I will try more devices and peripherals in the future.

# Examples

- Blink: blinking led with a delay
- Button, led, buzzer: a button used to activate a buzzer and led (ON when pushed, OFF otherwise)
- Neopixel: controlling neopixel arrays with the Neopixel adafruit library
- Neopixel, button animations: enable disable different neopixel animations with the button
